        Neste trabalho Gabriel Junqueira continua sua pesquisa sobre elementos físicos transformados em objetos tridimensionais através do uso do dispositivo Kinect, um sensor de captação de movimento. Se em "Diorama" (2016) ele buscara captar imagens do espaço urbano a sua volta, nesta proposição o artista escaneia o corpo humano.

          I really like beaches. The beach seems to be a point of departure for exploration and discovery. It also is a border, a division between sea and land, safety and potential danger. Beaches also are full of mystery — things wash up on the shore coming from far away places. They switch contexts, sometimes discovered and other times buried.

          I often lose myself in internet searches, looking for an answer to a technical question, opening various tabs, or scrolling through a feed. User experience is important here as it facilitates my searches. They say experience on the web shouldn’t make you think. Navigation through posted images and texts should be simple.

          Sand is like pixels. Each individual pixel could potentially represent an individual grain of sand, with each screen representative of a sort of beach or sandbox. But sandboxes and beaches are very different things, one a dislocation of the other.         </i>

        <i>
          Or maybe an entire image is like an individual grain of sand, and pixels are like molecules or the makeup of the single grain. If that were the case, to have a beach or a sandbox, you would need a very large amount of images.         </i>

          Of course, we could keep on going. Maybe the entire internet is a beach or an island and every registered domain is a grain of sand, a palm tree, a stream, or some exotic fruit. Or maybe there is no distinction between each piece of sand, and all we know is the existence of the main body. It’s possible for messages, images, or sand castles to be made in the sand, but eventually these things dissolve and are mixed into the main body through the movement of the tides. Or can they last? I suppose some do and others don’t. Maybe not always physically, but by some stylistic trace or specific will and spirit, there can operate a cohesion between them that sets them apart from any blurry image.

            Can something slow be made with quick things? Does so much quickness eventually begin to become slowness?

            The second to last paragraph of Robert Smithson’s "A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey" talks about a sandbox. It reads:

            "I should now like to prove the irreversibility of eternity by using a jejune experiment for proving eternity. Picture in your mind’s eye the sandbox divided in half with black sand on one side and white sand on the other. We take a child and have him run hundreds of times clockwise in the box until the sand gets mixed and begins to turn grey; after that we have him run anti-clockwise, but the result will not be a restoration of the original division but a greater degree of greyness and an increase of entropy."

            With every technological update, a new system is implemented. Past systems fall into obsolescence. They become foundation myths.

            "Black Sand White Sand Grey Sand" is a Google Chrome extension that temporarily manipulates and blurs webpages randomly for its users. These manipulations are then screenshot by the extension and sent to a server. Later, I post them onto a blog. The extension is available for download <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/black-sand-white-sand-gre/bcofpmgmfalomalhpmimoakibljcjchc">here.</a>
